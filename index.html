            <h3>How I got started in Computer Science</h3>
            <p>
                &ensp;&ensp;While I was in high school, I enrolled in the <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/SecondaryEducation/CareerCollegeReadiness/RunningStart.aspx">
                Running Start</a> program for my Junior and Senior
                year. Basically, it gave me two free years of college. In my area it was being offered at Olympic College
                in Bremerton, Washington, which is where I started my higher education.
                <br><br>
                &ensp;&ensp;I was at a point in my life where I wanted to find something that I could turn
                into a career. I had many hobbies and interests, but there wasn't anything that really
                jumped out at me. Writing was something I enjoyed doing, though I didn't see it as a profession to pursue.
                <br><br>
                &ensp;&ensp;I took some different classes in varying fields, but nothing was sticking. Eventually, a
                friend of mine that I played football with suggested I take the Programming Concepts course at OC. I
                registered the following quarter, went through the whole thing, and loved it. I still remember the
                professor, Mr. Dondi Hanson. I never met him in person, but he was a good teacher.
                <br><br>
                &ensp;&ensp;He started us with learning PHP. Not for using it in the normal sense, but for understanding the
                core principles of programming, hence the title of the course. We did some very simple assignments that
                taught us the basics of conditions, loops, variables, etc. It blew my mind that I was able to take a
                huge file filled with raw data (not so raw in that case, but it was cool nonetheless) and be able
                to turn it into readable logs that documented the trends in the information.
